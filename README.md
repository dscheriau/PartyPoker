## Game Description


Poker Fox is a round / real-time card game for two to six players with cheating features to increase the fun factor. 
Each player gets two cards and betting chips. The players put a different amount of money (chips) on the odds of winning 
their own hand without knowing about the opponent's hand. The chips of a game (pot) used by the players wins the player with 
the strongest hand. This opens up the opportunity to win by bluffing even with weak cards. 
The goal is to win as many chips as possible from other players.

## Cheating

Cheating is allowed once per round. Click on the Cheat button to select one of the two different cheat options(EYE, DEAD MANS HAND).
But beware, other players can clap you up by clicking the big round red button with the call sign and selecting the player who cheats.
If the player is correct, then the round ends for the cheating player and the player who pressed the button gets 1/5 of the chips from 
the player who has cheated.

* Eye - The Eye Cheat option gives you access to a card of any player.

* Dead man's Hand - With this special cheat option, it is possible to exchange one card from the entire deck of the deck for one of the two cards in your hand.
