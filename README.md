##Game Description


Poker Fox is a round / real-time card game for two to six players with cheating features to increase the fun factor. 
Each player gets two cards and betting chips. The players put a different amount of money (chips) on the odds of winning 
their own hand without knowing about the opponent's hand. The chips of a game (pot) used by the players wins the player with 
the strongest hand. This opens up the opportunity to win by bluffing even with weak cards. 
The goal is to win as many chips as possible from other players.
